        Final energy demand for all sectors.

        When looking at primary demand, exported oil(products) can play a big
        role if refeneries are still producing at a significant rate.
      </p>

    <h2>Electricity production</h2>

      <p>
        In your scenario, most electricity is produced by

      <p>
        The central heat network in your scenario can be used to heat houses and

          excess heat produced in agriculture or industry which flows back into the central heat
          network but is not used by other sectors.

        <p>You can balance the network by</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reducing heat production</strong>: in the industry and agriculture sections you can
            decrease numbers of CHPs and burners.</li>
          <li><strong>Increase demand</strong>: by increaing the demand of all sectors in the left-hand side
            of the diagram.</li>

          insufficient heat produced to satisfy the demand of the central heat network. A backup
          gas heater is deployed to satisfy the deficit.
        </p>

        <p>You can balance the network by</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Building more heat production</strong>: in the industry and agriculture sections you can
            generate more heat by increasing numbers of CHPs and burners.</li>

        In your scenario, CO2 emission reductions fall short of the Dutch ambitions of 40% in 2030
        and 80% - 95% in 2050. You can reduce CO2 by:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Realising energy savings</strong>: reduce energy consumption in the most energy-intensive sectors</li>
        <li><strong>Phasing out fossil fuels</strong>: heating and hot water in homes, transportation and electricity
          production are places where fossil fuels can be replaced by CO2-neutral alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>CCS(U)</strong>: Capturing, storing and, optionally, using CO2 can be viable options in the
          energy-intensive industry and electricity generation (energy) sector.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: storage and conversion technologies enable you to utilise energy which would
        otherwise be exported or curtailed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuel and CO2 pricing</strong>: by increasing the price of CO2 and fossil fuels, fossil plants might
        get less full load hours depending on the alternatives for electricity generation.</li>

    </p>
    <p>
    Usually no CO2 emissions are attributed to biomass as biomass absorbs as much CO2 as is emitted
    during combustion (over the complete life cycle). The CO2 emitted by combustion of biomass is
    not always absorbed within a time-scale that is relevant for climate change.
    </p>

    {% chart 188 %}
      Which part of the CO2 emissions from biomass is relevant to the environment is uncertain and
      speculative. This chart serves to explore the (potential) amount of these emissions.

      <h2>Merit order and fuel prices</h2>

        <p>
          The <i>merit order</i> ranks dispatchable power plants (those which you can switch on and off)
          according to their <i>marginal costs</i> (the costs of producing an extra MWh of electricity).
          Wind, solar and must-run plants have effectively zero marginal costs.
          The marginal costs and installed capacity of power generation for your scenario is shown in the
          chart below.
        </p>

        {% chart 125 %}
          Merit order.
        {% endchart %}

        <p>
          Depending on the demand for electricity, the merit order determines which plants are running for each hour
          of the year. The plants with lowest marginal costs will often (baseload generation) whereas plants with
          higher marginal costs might only run in cases of peak demand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fuel prices determine to a large extend the marginal costs of power plants. Increasing the proce of coal
          and/or CO2 can, for instance, make gas fueled power plants more compatitive with coal fired power plants.

  <h1 class="banner">Security of supply and profitability of power plants</h1>

    <h2>Reliability</h2>

    <p>
      The loss of load expectation (LOLE) is the expected number of hours per year that the electricity
       supply cannot meet its demand. A nonzero LOLE does not necessarily result in blackouts as
       electricity can be imported or can be available in batteries. The Netherlands accepts a
       LOLE of 4 h/yr. We distinguish (un)reliable electricity production as volatile electricity
       producers cannot be relied on at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
      In your scenario, there is {{ future.dispatchable_electricity_production_capacity | autoscale: 'MW' }} of
      reliable (dispatchable) electricity production. Resulting in

    {% chart 111 %}

    {% endchart %}

    <p>
      Similar to LOLE, the number of blackout hours is a measure for the reliability of the electricity

      prevent a shortage of power.
    </p>

      <h2>Profitability of power plants</h2>

        <p>
          Security of (electricity) supply and the profitability of power plants are intimately linked.
          For dispatchable power plants to make money, they need to run sufficiently often, ideally when
          electricity prices are high.
          A reliable electricity system traditionally requires, however,
          that there are power plants available which are only needed for a couple of extreme demand peaks
          every year.
        </p>

        <p>
          In your scenario, {{ future.profitability_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }}% of powerplants is not
          profitable. This means that they are not earning back their investment costs
          (orange in table below) or are not even earning their OPEX (operational expenditure) back (red).
        </p>

        {% chart 140 %}
          Profitability of power plants.
        {% endchart %}

        <p>
          Unprofitable plants will likely be taken out of commission after a while. You can improve their profitability
          by incereasing electricity demand (making them run more hours). Also reducing electricity generation with zero
          marginal costs can make power plants profitable again.

  <h1 class="banner">APPENDIX C: About The Energy Transition Model</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com">Energy Transition Model (ETM)</a> is
        a free, open-source, web-based
         energy model for the exploration of energy scenario's.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ETM is for anyone who wants to explore and create energy scenarios for countries, cities,
        neighbourhoods and even streets.
        No prior knowledge is assumed and the ETM is therefore of interest to both experts and students.
        You can make assumptions about demand and supply of different types of energy from the source to
        the application. the ETM determines, for all stakeholders in the system, sustainability, reliability
        and affordability at national and local level.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can look up how the ETM compares to other models on
        <a href="www.energierekenmodellen.nl">energierekenmodellen.nl</a>.
      </p>


    <h2>Beyond The Energy Transition Model</h2>

        <br>
        <strong>George Box</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Quintel strives to properly include all important features of the energy system, the ETM nescessarily
        has a limited scope and should not be used as a substitute for critical thought. On the contrary! Hopefully, the
        user is inspired to challenge results and limits of the model and starts thinking outside of the boudaries of
        the Energy Transition Model.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following (very) incomplete list of topics is indicative of the limits of the ETM:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Human behaviour</strong>: arguably the biggest impact on the success of failure of energy transition
            is declared out of scope of the primarily technical ETM.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic relations</strong>: the ETM calculates costs based on published values but does not assume
            price-elasticity relations or other economic relations which may no longer apply in the future.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy</strong>: no subsedies or taxes are assumed in the ETM, they are viewed as the possible
            motivation for the choices of the user, however.</li>
        </ul>
